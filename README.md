# Pong

Undoubtedly the "Hello World" of Processing, Pong was fun to make last year. It's still a bit buggy, particualry in the intro sequence because of the sketchy support for the `delay();` method. It works in Processing 1.5.1 though. Kind of. As far as I remember the audio files take ages to load, and when they do the pitch decreases each time they get played. Weird bug, minim.

## How To

Play the sketch in Processing 1.5.1. The controls are 'w' and 's' for the left hand paddle, and 'UP' and 'DOWN' for the right paddle. Yes, it's only multiplayer, I'll have to figure out some way of letting a user play against a computer.
